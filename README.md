# FavouriteFilms
Everyone has had a situation where you want to watch a good movie, but you don't know which one and where to find it. To solve this problem, I decided to implement the program FAVORITE_FILMS.

The task of the program is to create a database to which users can add information about their favorite movies, and links to them. In addition, users can view the data according to the criteria set.
